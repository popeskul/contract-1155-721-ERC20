# Homework Assignment

**NFT Contract Based on the ERC-721 Standard**

## Objective

Write a smart contract for creating NFTs in compliance with the ERC-721 standard.

## Instructions / Step-by-Step Guide

1. Create your own ERC20 token using **Remix IDE** and **Solidity**.
2. Deploy this token contract to an Ethereum testnet.
3. Write a smart contract that creates NFTs based on the **ERC-721** standard.
   *(Optional: You may also implement a token using the **ERC-1155** standard.)*
4. Study common **vulnerabilities** in token contracts. To deepen your understanding, try to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in your own contracts.
5. Your contract must be **tested** (at least with a minimal test suite).
6. Push the code to a **version control system** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
